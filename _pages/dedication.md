A collection of quotes from family, friends, and Howard's cats - Gibbs and Loki.

> A remarkable collection of stories and life experiences that will help others work through their own internal conflicts.

> Your philosophy of life has always encouraged you to excel at any task that you engage in. With your book, you have gathered information over countless years both from your own experiences and from other sources of support. Watching you work so tirelessly to compile all of this information so that you can help others with struggles that you have personally experienced and reading quite a bit of the material, I can truly say that you have put your heart and soul completely into this book. I am so proud of you for all you have accomplished so far. The finish line is near and I look forward to crossing it with you!

> I’ve had a life long for interest in photography. Well at least back to 1981. This has led to me being a Minor League Baseball photographer for the last four years. Any success I’ve had is in part due to dads support, both morally and monetarily, which has been unwavering. And by success I mean making friends both on and off the field. And then there is the little thing of the 2,627,311 views on Flickr of my photos. I think that is something we can both be proud of.

> From my earliest days I remember learning so many life hacks from dad, from mnemonic devices (MVEMJSUNP sure does have a ring to it!) to how jewelers use code words on tags so customers never know what labels mean. And with more serious topics - challenges we humans face - he’s always been there to lend an ear and offer measured and sage advice. All of which is captured and translated in BTUT.
