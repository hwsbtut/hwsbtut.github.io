  hero__title: Been There Undone That
  hero__description: This book is intended to be my gift to every person who chooses to read it. It is the product of my life and journey to heal certain debilitating aspects of my thinking and the excessive anxiety and stress my thinking created for me. There are hundreds of books on healing written by professionals in the mental health field which are intended to help those of us with these issues get better and overcome them. On the other hand, I am aware of only a precious few good ones that are written from the “user’s” point of view, as this one is - from the point of view of the lab rat, so to speak, or the affected person, the one suffering in the trenches every day. While I do think of myself as a lab rat at times, I like to picture myself as being a smart lab rat, one capable of learning, albeit slowly at times. Overall, I hope that you enjoy the collections and stories and advice that I have put together, and that you too can pass on this advice one day.
